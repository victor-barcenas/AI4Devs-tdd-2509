# Test Mocks

This directory contains mock objects, functions, and data for testing.

## Structure
- `prisma.mock.ts` - Prisma client mocks
- `fileSystem.mock.ts` - File system operation mocks
- `external-apis.mock.ts` - External API response mocks

## Usage Example
```typescript
import { mockPrismaClient } from '../mocks/prisma.mock';

jest.mock('@prisma/client', () => ({
  PrismaClient: jest.fn(() => mockPrismaClient)
}));
```

## Guidelines
- Mock external dependencies consistently
- Provide both success and error scenarios
- Keep mocks simple and focused
