# Test Fixtures

This directory contains static test data and fixtures used across different test types.

## Structure
- `candidates.json` - Sample candidate data
- `educations.json` - Sample education records
- `workExperiences.json` - Sample work experience records
- `files/` - Sample file uploads (PDFs, DOCX)

## Usage Example
```typescript
import candidateFixtures from '../fixtures/candidates.json';

const validCandidate = candidateFixtures.validComplete;
```

## Guidelines
- Keep fixtures realistic but anonymized
- Update fixtures when data models change
- Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
